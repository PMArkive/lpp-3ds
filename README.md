# Preamble

This is a **fork** of the actual [lpp-3ds](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds).
It expands it's functionality slightly to function within [3dfetch](https://github.com/yyualice/3dfetch).

It is absolutely incompatible with the newest release of devkitARM and will not compile, same as the original source.

I **highly** advise against attempts to build this yourself, as it is a rather painful and lengthy process due to it not being updated for the newest devkitARM,
however, due to developer obligations I am going to attempt to provide a short reference guide for the building process.

Prerequisites:

- gcc
- devkitARM r45 (yes, 45, not 46)
- aemstro

As my last 2 days of attempts to make lpp-3ds compile with devkitARM r46 were not particularly fruitfull and filled with sorrow
and dread, here is a short guide:

* Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/daedreth/lpp-3ds.git`
* Clone aemstro: `git clone https://github.com/smealum/aemstro.git`
* Set an environmental variable AEMSTRO to point to your cloned aemstro repository: `export AEMSTRO=/path/to/aemstro/repo`
* Download the outdated devkitARM from: `https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/devkitARM/devkitARM_r45/`

We proceed assuming that you already have an up to date devkitARM installation, if not, it doesn't matter.

* Create a directory for the outdated devkitARM: `sudo mkdir -p /opt/devkitpro/devkitARM_old`
* Assign permissions to be able to use it easily: `sudo chmod 777 /opt/devkitpro/devkitARM_old`
* Copy the devkitARM r45 tarball to the newly created repository and unpack it: `tar -xvjf devkitARM_r45-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2`
* Temporarily export environmental variables: `export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro && export DEVKITARM=/opt/devkitpro/devkitARM_old`
* Enter the lpp-3ds directory and run `make` , this should be enough to compile the interpreter.
* If an error regarding `CRT` is being shown, you have to recompile the library: `cd $DEVKITARM/arm-none-eabi/lib && make CRT=3dsx`

The possibility that further errors arise is rather high, if you are foolish enough to subject yourself to this madness instead of downloading a precompiled binary
and encounter some weird issues despite following these steps, open an issue.

# Compiling the source

The repository will provide you a full set of all of the needed libraries. Take in mind that a lot of them are modified versions of the original ones so if you want to update them, take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-3ds_libraries) where you can find sourcecodes of every pre-builded library used in this repository. Also take in mind that **libkhax** includes also **libSu** sourcecode. Last but not least, please note that **libjpeg.a** file is a standard compilation of libjpeg-turbo.<br><br>
Lua Player Plus 3DS supports different flags to enables some features:<br>
**-DUSE_MEMCHUNKHAX2** enables memchunkhax2 usage through svchax at startup for firmwares between 9.3 and 10.7.<br>
**-DCITRA3DS_COMPATIBLE** removes romFs support causing Citra3DS emulator crash.<br>
**-DSKIP_ERROR_HANDLING** disables error handling for faster code execution (this is used for Unsafe version).<br>
**-DFORCE_SD** forces interpreter to load main script from SD instead of romFs filesystem.<br>
**-DFORCE_DSP** forces interpreter to use dsp::DSP audio service even if csnd:SND is available.<br>
